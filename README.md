# Admin PowerTools

This project was initally created to create fancy list view for records that Salesforce has not migrated to Lightning yet.
Though the code for that still exists and can be used, it has evolved into a suite of powertools for admin users.

TODO: UPDATE README

In the salesforce_administration_package.xml, you can see three examples of this. In it there is a custom tab defined for "Users", "Permission Sets", and "Public Groups & Queues". This is just one example. 

The only code required to use this tool is listed in the package.xml file.

To use this tool, all you need to do is create a lightning web component configured to be tab-accessible. Then in the lightning web component, add in the c-custom-record-list component and you'll be good to go.

## Example

```
<template>
  <c-custom-record-list
    label="Groups"
    icon-name="standard:groups"
    object-api-name="Group"
    fields={fields}
    new-record-link={newRecordLink}
    view-link={viewLink}
    columns={columns}
  ></c-custom-record-list>
</template>
```

## API

- `label` the label of your component, typically the plural of whichever record you're pulling.
- `name-field` defaults to "Name", this is the name of the record. In some cases this may not be "Name", ex. for Permission Sets this would be "Label".
- `icon-name` the name of the icon, typically it's whatever icon aligns with the records you're listing.
- `object-api-name` the API name of the SObject.
- `fields` the list fields you want displayed
- `new-record-link` defaults to the standard Salesforce link for new records. For setup objects (ex. Groups, Users) you'll want to use the links from the setup page.
- `view-link` the link to view the record. Defaults to the standard record view page. For setup objects, you'll want to use the links from the setup page.
- `columns` the columns of the table. This tool uses a custom lightning-datatable, the custom-record-list-lightning-datatable. It extends the standard lightning-datatable with two new column types.
  - `formattedLink` works with the name-field. Whatever field is set to the name-field will be transformed into a link to the record. The fieldApiName should be "Name", since a fake "Name" column will be added to the data to support this. The label can be whatever you want.
  - `parentNameField` is used when you want to pull in the "Name" field from a related record. For example for Users, you'll want to pull in UserRole.Name.
